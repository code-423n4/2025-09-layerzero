🔎 **Got audit-related questions? Here's your roadmap** 

Find the information you need efficiently:

1. Step 1: **Review project documentation** in the audit repo. [Join the audit](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-09-layerzero-endpoint-v2-sui) for access.
2. Step 2: Use **🤖 Docs Wolf,** C4's documentation bot assistant. Open a private thread, tag `@Docs Wolf`, and ask your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.

**Please note: **
- Docs Wolf will be available within 24-48 hours of launch. We'll post a note once it's live.
- The LayerZero team is not available for questions, so the Q&A option has been disabled for this competition.

Good hunting!
